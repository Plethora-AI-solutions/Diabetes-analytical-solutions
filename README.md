This is an experimental project that simply and quickly helps patients diagnose their diabetes in seconds! In fact, this diabetes system supports practitioners to accurately diagnose diabetes for their patients. Personally, as some of our family members have been diagnosed with diabetes, I wanted to provide an easier and faster alternative for individuals to find out if they have diabetes and what information and support, they could use to manage their illness (if positive). Our experiment diagnosis system began in June 2023, and we have drastically developed in scope - to ensure patients get accurate diagnoses and a simpler interface to navigate around the system. We hope this diagnoses solution helps you and any stake holders find out if YOU have diabetes. We have provided broad resources for you to manage any symptoms you may have! We would extremely appreciate any feedback to improving the trail diagnosis system - whether technical, medical or any other support!
